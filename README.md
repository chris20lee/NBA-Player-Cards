# NBA-Player-Cards
Drawing inspiration from JFresh's NHL player cards to create NBA player cards.

The JFresh NHL player cards takes various advance statistics for a given NHL player in a given season, and converts it into a percentile rank value, in order to easily compare an NHL players performance against their peers.

These NHL player cards provide a quick and easy snapshot at a players value from an advanced statistics point of view.

Given how popular these player cards have been on the NHL side, I was surprised to not see this replicated in this form for NBA players. This project aims to take JFresh's approach and apply it to the NBA. All data is web scraped from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)
